### Overview
**Problem.** Students—and sometimes instructors—struggle to recall formal logical structures in the middle of an argument-mapping activity.  
**Solution.** A durable, two-page quick-reference guide that reduces search friction to *zero*: just flip the sheet.

### Highlights

| Page | Section | Why it matters |
|------|---------|----------------|
| 1    | “Arguments ≠ Fights” comic | Disarms the common misconception that *argument* means hostility. |
| 1    | Validity & Soundness panels | Presents the core distinction in plain language plus truth-table icons. |
| 2    | Eleven valid logical forms  | Modus Ponens, Modus Tollens, Disjunctive Syllogism, etc.—color-coded for scan-and-go. |
| 2    | Indicator-word table        | Quickly maps ordinary-language cues (*because, either/or, unless*) to their logical connectives. |

---

### Usage scenarios
* **In-class reference** during argument-mapping workshops.  
* **Self-study aid** in an online logic course (QR code on the sheet links to deeper explainers).  
* **Desk laminate** for instructors grading short-answer logic exams.

1. Built in **Adobe InDesign**; exported to high-resolution PDF, then down-sampled (≈650 KB) for web delivery.  
2. All icons created in **Vyond** to match my eLearning brand palette.  
3. Accessibility tested—AA contrast and alt-text embedded in the PDF metadata.

### What‚Äôs inside üìë  
The guide distills an entire 15-week *Logic & Critical Thinking* unit onto two pages that fit front-and-back of a US-letter laminate. Highlights include:

* **Arguments vs. fights** ‚Äì the cartoon strip (upper-right of page 1) contrasts persuasion with personal conflict. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
* **Validity & logical connectives** ‚Äì color-coded panels define *negation, conditionals,* and more, with truth-table shortcuts. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
* **Eleven valid logical forms** ‚Äì a quick-scan table (bottom-center of page 2) lists *Modus Ponens, Disjunctive Syllogism,* and others. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}
* **Reference tables** ‚Äì indicator words for each connective (left column of page 2) plus concise definitions of *truth* vs. *soundness.* :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

> **Use-case:** students keep the laminate at their desk during argument-mapping exercises; QR codes in the corners link to deeper video explainers.
